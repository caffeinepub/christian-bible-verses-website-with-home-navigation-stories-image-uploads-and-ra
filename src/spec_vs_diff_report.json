There are also metadata/documentation summary updates not explicitly requested by REQ-18.",

      "requirement": "Publish (deploy) the current draft build to the production site so that the live site reflects the latest draft version.",
      "reason": "The diff only adds a deployment runbook/guide; it does not include any actual deploy action, CI/CD pipeline/config, environment/hosting configuration, or other changes that would perform or trigger a production publish. Acceptance criteria require the production site to be updated, which is not evidenced by documentation alone.",
