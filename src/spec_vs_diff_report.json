      "requirement": "Roll back the live production site from Version 6 to the previously deployed Version 5 (production rollback only; do not change the draft/codebase).",
      "reason": "No deployment/rollback procedure changes or deployment-target changes are shown in the diff. The only modified file is `project_state.json`, which does not demonstrate switching production from v6 to v5 or following `frontend/DEPLOYMENT.md`.",
