# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Publish (deploy) the current draft build to the production site so the live site matches the latest draft.

**Planned changes:**
- Deploy the most recent draft build to the production (live) environment.
- Verify the production site reflects the same behavior/content as the latest draft after deployment.

**User-visible outcome:** Visiting the production site shows the latest draft version’s behavior/content.
